   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Findig's documentation!
==================================

Findig is a micro-framework for developing HTTP applications in Python. It is 
built on Werkzeug_ and is intended as an alternative to Flask_ when 
developing RESTful APIs.

.. _werkzeug: http://werkzeug.pocoo.org
.. _flask: http://flask.pocoo.org

The documentation is split into two parts: the user guide (which includes
installation and quickstart instructions) and detailed API documentation.

.. note:: 

	The documentation here isn't complete yet. If you stumble 
	across something that you think should be documented, but isn't,
	please feel free to 
	`let us know about it <https://github.com/geniphi/findig/issues/new>`_ 
	on our issue tracker.

	You may also clone the 
	`Github Repository <https://github.com/geniphi/findig>`_ and submit
	pull requests with documentation fixes for review.

Findig uses Werkzeug internally, and so some understanding of how
Werkzeug works and its data types, while not necessary, will
almost certainly be helpful:

* `Werkzeug documentation <http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/docs>`_.
