Higher-level tools
==================

The :mod:`findig.tools` package contains modules each implementing
higher-level tools for use on Findig applications and resources. They're
completely optional, but using them should make writing a Findig 
application significantly easier. These
tools are implemented in such a way that they can be easily dropped into
any Findig application to provide additional functionality without making
any underlying changes. The tools available are documented in the 
following pages:
